## Induction and Causation

### Induction
- Definition: A form of reasoning based on how probable a conclusion is given the premises.
- Example: "Every swan I've seen is white, so all swans must be white."

### Causal Reasoning
- Definition: A key inductive practice involving the determination of cause-and-effect relationships.
- Example: Determining whether smoking causes lung cancer.

### Questionable Cause Fallacy
- Definition: An error in causal reasoning where the causal claim is incorrect.
- Example: "The meteor shower occurred because I desired it to."

### Post hoc ergo propter hoc (Post hoc)
- Definition: A fallacy assuming that because event Y follows event X in time, X must have caused Y.
- Example: "I wore my lucky socks and then aced my exam, so my socks must have caused my success."

### Cum hoc ergo propter hoc
- Definition: A fallacy assuming that because events X and Y occur together (simultaneously), they must be causally related.
- Example: "Ice cream sales and crime rates both increase in summer, so ice cream must cause crime."
- Key Difference from Post hoc: Cum hoc involves correlation without temporal order, while post hoc involves a temporal sequence.

### Single Cause Fallacy
- Definition: Claiming a single cause when there are multiple complex causes working together.
- Example: "The housing market alone caused the 2008 economic crash."

### Correlation vs. Causation
- Definition: The principle that correlation between two events does not necessarily imply causation.
- Example: There's a correlation between shoe size and reading ability in children, but larger shoes don't cause better reading (age affects both).

## Statistics and Probability

### Biased Sample
- Definition: A sample that is not representative of the target population.
- Example: Conducting a political poll only among college students.

### Randomization
- Definition: A method to prevent biased samples by ensuring each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
- Example: Using a random number generator to select participants for a study.

### Stratification
- Definition: Ensuring the percentage of relevant subpopulations in a sample matches the target population.
- Example: Making sure a voting poll includes the correct proportions of different age groups, genders, and geographic locations.

### Gambler's Fallacy
- Definition: Treating independent probability events as dependent.
- Example: "The roulette wheel has landed on black 5 times in a row, so it's due for red."

### Independent Events
- Definition: Events where past instances have no bearing on future events.
- Example: Coin flips are independent; each flip has a 50/50 chance regardless of previous flips.

### Dependent Events
- Definition: Events where past instances do have a bearing on future events.
- Example: Drawing cards from a deck without replacement; the probability changes with each draw.

### Base Rate Fallacy
- Definition: Drawing an unjustified conclusion about an event by ignoring the rate at which it normally occurs.
- Example: "I've only been attacked by sharks in summer, so they must only attack in summer." (Ignoring that people swim more in summer.)

## Logical Fallacies

### Slippery Slope Fallacy
- Definition: Attempting to refute a claim by arguing that accepting it will lead to a chain of undesirable consequences, without proper justification for each step.
- Example: "If we allow same-sex marriage, next people will want to marry animals!"

### Hasty Generalization
- Definition: Drawing a conclusion about a general population based on characteristics of only a few members.
- Example: "My neighbor is rude, so all people from his country must be rude."

### Fallacy of Unfalsifiability
- Definition: Changing the definition of a term, concept, or world-view in an ad hoc way to avoid criticism.
- Example: Conspiracy theories that are set up so they can never be falsified.

### "No True Scotsman" Fallacy
- Definition: Disregarding falsifying evidence by claiming no true member of the group would commit bad actions.
- Example: "No true Scotsman would commit such a crime."

## Cognitive Errors

### Confirmation Bias
- Definition: The tendency to notice and exaggerate evidence that confirms our beliefs while ignoring or overlooking evidence that disconfirms them.
- Example: A sports fan remembering all the great plays their team made but forgetting the mistakes.
- Causes:
  1. It feels good to be right and less good to be wrong
  2. Personal investment (emotional, financial, reputational)
  3. Getting evidence from selected information sources
  4. Proneness to group conformity

### The Backfire Effect
- Definition: When challenging someone's misinformation about a strongly held belief causes them to endorse the false belief more strongly.
- Example: Presenting evidence against conspiracy theories sometimes makes believers more convinced of the conspiracy.

### Plato's Allegory of the Cave
- Definition: A philosophical concept suggesting that people often cling to false beliefs rather than face reality.
- Example: Prisoners chained in a cave, seeing only shadows on a wall, believe these shadows are reality and resist leaving the cave to see the true world outside.

### Seeking Disconfirming Evidence
- Definition: Actively looking for information that challenges our beliefs to counteract confirmation bias.
- Example: A researcher deliberately seeking out studies that contradict their hypothesis.

## Psychology

### Sensory Perception

#### Constructive Perception
- Definition: The mind's tendency to shape sensory experience, sometimes "filling in" information.
- Example: The blind spot in our vision where the optic nerve connects to the retina; our brain fills in this gap.
#### Selective Perception
- Definition: Focusing on what's central instead of the periphery.
- Example: Not noticing a gorilla walking through a basketball game when focused on counting passes (as in the famous "Invisible Gorilla" experiment).
### Memory

#### Selective Memory
- Definition: Remembering the past in ways that serve our interests.
- Example: Recalling only the positive aspects of a past relationship after a breakup.
#### Post-event Information Effect
- Definition: Information occurring after an event can shape our memory of that event.
- Example: Eyewitness testimony being influenced by news reports about a crime.
#### Closure and Continuity
- Definition: Remembering events differently to achieve harmony with others.
- Example: Changing one's memory of a shared experience to match a friend's recollection.
#### Duration
- Definition: The bigger the gap between an event and your memory of it, the greater the chance you will misremember it.
#### Transferred Memories
- Definition: Transferring memories from one event to another.
- Example: Mistakenly remembering a friend at a party they didn't attend because they were at a similar party recently.
### Other Cognitive Errors

#### Projection
- Definition: Projecting our emotions and beliefs onto other people or the world.
- Example: Assuming others are angry when you're feeling irritable.
#### Transference
- Definition: Transferring negative feelings towards a safer person or object.
- Example: Taking out frustration with a boss on a family member.
#### Denial
- Definition: Ignoring or denying things we don't like about the world or ourselves, despite evidence.
- Example: Refusing to acknowledge a gambling problem despite financial difficulties.
#### Confirmation Bias: 
- We can notice and exaggerate evidence that confirms our beliefs and suspicions. This occurs when evidence seems to overwhelmingly support our view.
#### A Little Bit of Knowledge
- Definition: Recognizing that expertise in one area doesn't imply expertise in others.
#### False Consensus
- Definition: Thinking that many people agree with something when they don't.
- Example: Assuming most people share your political views because your close friends do.
#### Naive Realism
- Definition: The belief that our sensory experience presents the world exactly as it is in reality.
- Example: Believing that the way we perceive colors is the only way they can be perceived, ignoring variations in color perception among individuals.
## Science and Its Characteristics

### Value of Science
- Usefulness: Advances in fields like dentistry and childbirth practices.
- Agreement: More likely to produce agreement than other fields (e.g., gravity vs. political opinions).
- Epistemic value: Allows us to make gains in knowledge.
### Types of Science
- Natural sciences: Physics, chemistry, biology, etc.
- Social sciences: Psychology, sociology, anthropology, aspects of political science, etc.
### Evolution of Science
- Modern science differs from Aristotelian science.
- Views about "nature" have changed over time and vary between cultures.
### Science and Technology
- Deep connection between science and technology.
- Critique: Technological thinking promotes the idea that humans are against nature and must conquer it.
- Heidegger's concept: Nature as "standing reserve" for human use.
## Scientific Method and Empiricism

### Empirical Method
- Unifying factor across sciences.
- Seeks causal explanations for phenomena.
- Raises questions about explaining human behavior in social sciences.
### Empiricism
- Scientific claims must be grounded in confirmable observations.
- Unobservable claims can be verified if related to observable claims in uniform ways.
### Verification and Falsification
- Logical issues with verification (problem of inference).
- Falsification (disproving a hypothesis) seems more promising.
- Nothing is truly "proved" in science.
### Paradigms
- Observations understood within larger networks of ideas.
- "Revolutionary science" occurs when observations don't fit existing paradigms.
## Limits and Criticisms of Science

### Scope of Science
- Question: Will science eventually explain all facts, or are there certain types of questions beyond its scope?
- Possible limits: Aspects of reality beyond empirical observation.
### Is-Ought Fallacy
- Science cannot directly tell us what the right thing to do is.
- Limits of science in morality, aesthetics, and politics.
### Human vs. Natural Sciences
- Question: Can humans be studied similarly to nature?
- Debate on continuity between humanity and nature.
### Non-Scientific Entities
- Possibility of entities (e.g., angels, demons, souls) outside scientific measurement.
### Environmental and Ethical Concerns
- Critique: Scientific/technological thinking leading to environmental destruction and objectification of people.
- Debates on technology use (e.g., smartphones in schools, social media age limits).
### Free Will and Determinism
- Question: Can social sciences truly explain human behavior given the concept of free will?

By understanding these concepts and the nature of science, we can better appreciate both the power and limitations of scientific inquiry, as well as common errors in reasoning that can affect our understanding of the world.

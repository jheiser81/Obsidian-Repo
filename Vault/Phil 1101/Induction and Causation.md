# Induction and Causation Summary 

## Introduction to Induction
Induction is a form of reasoning based on how ***probable*** a conclusion is given the premises. It's a fundamental concept in critical thinking and scientific reasoning.

## Causal Reasoning
- Causal reasoning is a key inductive practice.
- It's one of the most important forms of critical thinking, but also one of the toughest to get right.
- Causal reasoning is common in science, law, commerce, politics, morality, and ordinary life.
- Establishing causality is very challenging, and philosophers are still debating the nature of causation.

## Common Fallacies in Causal Reasoning

### 1. Questionable Cause Fallacy
- Definition: Incorrect causal claim. Something happened *because* (wrong reason) 
- Example: "The meteor shower occurred because I desired it to."

### 2. Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (Post Hoc)
- Definition: "After this, therefore, because of this."
- Thinking that X caused Y because Y regularly occurs after X.
- This is one of the most common causal fallacies.
- Main difference between Post Hoc and Cum Hoc is time; post hoc assumes an incorrect sequence of events 

### 3. Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc
- Definition: "With this, therefore because of this."
- Also known as the "correlation is not causation" fallacy.
- Example: If I get a raise at work every time the Liberals win an election, it does not mean the latter caused the former.

### 4. Single Cause Fallacy
- Definition: Claiming a single cause when there are multiple causes working together.
- Example: "Sex scenes in movies cause more sexual promiscuity in the populace."

## Structure of Causal Reasoning

1. Causal events must always be related (necessarily).
2. Causes cannot operate at a distance (in space and time) from their effects.
3. Causal judgments are explained by a theory of how one mechanism leads necessarily to another.
4. Each causal judgment must be logically consistent with every other causal judgment.

### Correlation vs. Causation
Correlation: Relationship/association
Causation: Cause and effect

Correlation between two events ***does not*** necessarily imply causation.

If two events, X and Y are associated, there are four possibilities:
1. X causes Y
2. Y causes X
3. There is a common cause, Z, of both X and Y
4. X and Y are only accidentally related

This shows that correlations cannot determine causation by themselves.

## Statistics and Probability

### Sampling
- We draw conclusions from a sample of the targeted population.
- When samples are not representative, they are biased.
- The best way to block a biased sample is to randomize the sample.

### Stratification 
- The percentage of relevant subpopulations in the sample matches the target population.

### Common Statistical Fallacies

1. **The Gambler's Fallacy**
   - Definition: Treating independent probability events as dependent.
   - Example: "The coin has been heads 4 times in a row, it's due to come up tails this time."
   - Independent events: past instances have ***no*** bearing on future events
   - Dependent events: past instances ***do*** have a bearing on future events

2. **Base Rate Fallacy**
   - Definition: Drawing an unjustified conclusion about an event because you ignore the ***rate*** at which the event normally occurs.
   - Example: "I've only been attacked by sharks in Summer, so they must only attack in Summer."

3. **Slippery Slope Fallacy**
   - Definition: Attempting to refute a claim by claiming that accepting it initiates a causal chain leading to dire, unacceptable, or unwanted consequences.
   - The problem is that the arguer does not justify at least one of the steps in the chain.
   - Example: "If we legalize pot, crime will go up and if crime goes up, my kids won't be safe. So we shouldn't legalize pot."

4. **Hasty Generalization**
   - Definition: Believing a conclusion based on a weak generalization.
   - Typically, this fallacy occurs when you conclude things about a general population based on the characteristics of only a few members
   - Example: "My neighbors are Christians and they are stupid, so all Christians are stupid."
## Conclusion
Understanding induction and causation is crucial for critical thinking and scientific reasoning. By being aware of common fallacies and the complexities of establishing causal relationships, we can improve our ability to draw accurate conclusions from the information available to us.

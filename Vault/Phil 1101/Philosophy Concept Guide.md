# Definition and Concept Guide: Philosophy, Logic, and Cognitive Biases



## Induction and Causation

**[Induction](Induction%20and%20Causation)**: A form of reasoning based on how probable a conclusion is given the premises. 
   Example: "Every swan I've seen is white, so all swans must be white."

**[Causal Reasoning](Induction%20and%20Causation)**: A key inductive practice involving the determination of cause-and-effect relationships.
   Example: Determining whether smoking causes lung cancer.

**Questionable Cause Fallacy**: An error in causal reasoning where the causal claim is incorrect.
   Example: "The meteor shower occurred because I desired it to."

**Post hoc ergo propter hoc (Post hoc)**: A fallacy assuming that because event Y follows event X in time, X must have caused Y.
   Example: "I wore my lucky socks and then aced my exam, so my socks must have caused my success."

**Cum hoc ergo propter hoc**: A fallacy assuming that because events X and Y occur together (simultaneously), they must be causally related.
   Example: "Ice cream sales and crime rates both increase in summer, so ice cream must cause crime."

   Key Difference: Post hoc involves a temporal sequence (X then Y), while cum hoc involves correlation without temporal order.

 **Single Cause Fallacy**: Claiming a single cause when there are multiple complex causes working together.
   Example: "The housing market alone caused the 2008 economic crash."

 **Correlation vs. Causation**: The principle that correlation between two events does not necessarily imply causation.
   Example: There's a correlation between shoe size and reading ability in children, but larger shoes don't cause better reading (age affects both).
### Statistics and Probability

**Biased Sample**: A sample that is not representative of the target population.
   Example: Conducting a political poll only among college students.

**Randomization**: A method to prevent biased samples by ensuring each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
   Example: Using a random number generator to select participants for a study.

**Stratification**: Ensuring the percentage of relevant subpopulations in a sample matches the target population.
    Example: Making sure a voting poll includes the correct proportions of different age groups, genders, and geographic locations.

**Gambler's Fallacy**: Treating independent probability events as dependent.
    Example: "The roulette wheel has landed on black 5 times in a row, so it's due for red."
	**Independent Events**: Events where past instances have no bearing on future events.
    Example: Coin flips are independent; each flip has a 50/50 chance regardless of previous flips.
	**Dependent Events**: Events where past instances do have a bearing on future events.
    Example: Drawing cards from a deck without replacement; the probability changes with each draw.

**Base Rate Fallacy**: Drawing an unjustified conclusion about an event by ignoring the rate at which it normally occurs.
    Example: "I've only been attacked by sharks in summer, so they must only attack in summer." (Ignoring that people swim more in summer.)
### Logical Fallacies

**Slippery Slope Fallacy**: Attempting to refute a claim by arguing that accepting it will lead to a chain of undesirable consequences, without proper justification for each step.
    Example: "If we allow same-sex marriage, next people will want to marry animals!"

**Hasty Generalization**: Drawing a conclusion about a general population based on characteristics of only a few members.
    Example: "My neighbor is rude, so all people from his country must be rude."
## Cognitive Errors

### Confirmation Bias###

**Confirmation Bias**: The tendency to notice and exaggerate evidence that confirms our beliefs while ignoring or overlooking evidence that disconfirms them.
	Example: A sports fan remembering all the great plays their team made but forgetting the mistakes.

**The Backfire Effect**: When challenging someone's misinformation about a strongly held belief causes them to endorse the false belief more strongly.
	Example: Presenting evidence against conspiracy theories sometimes makes believers more convinced of the conspiracy.

 **Plato's Allegory of the Cave**: A philosophical concept suggesting that people often cling to false beliefs rather than face reality.
    Example: Prisoners chained in a cave, seeing only shadows on a wall, believe these shadows are reality and resist leaving the cave to see the true world outside.
    
**Why Confirmation Bias Occurs:
1. It feels good to be right and less good to be wrong

2. We are invested personally
	- Emotional investment
	- Financial investment
	- Reputational investment
	
3. We get out evidence from selected information sources
	- News
	- Social media
	
4. We are prone to group conformity
	- We want to belong

**Seeking Disconfirming Evidence**: Actively looking for information that challenges our beliefs to counteract confirmation bias.
    Example: A researcher deliberately seeking out studies that contradict their hypothesis.
### Psychology

#### Sensory Perception

 **Constructive Perception**: The mind's tendency to shape sensory experience, sometimes "filling in" information. Our minds translate experiences in ways that "make sense", even if it doesn't correspond to reality.
    Example: The blind spot in our vision where the optic nerve connects to the retina; our brain fills in this gap.
    
 **Selective Perception**: Focusing on what's central instead of the periphery. We focus on what's beneficial to us and miss aspects of the environment that don't help us (inattentional blindness)
    Example: Not noticing a gorilla walking through a basketball game when focused on counting passes (as in the famous "Invisible Gorilla" experiment).
#### Memory ####

**Selective Memory**: Remembering the past in ways that serve our interests.
    Example: Recalling only the positive aspects of a past relationship after a breakup.

**Post-event Information Effect**: Information occurring after an event can shape our memory of that event.
    Example: Eyewitness testimony being influenced by news reports about a crime.

 **Closure and Continuity**: Remembering events differently to achieve harmony with others.
    Example: Changing one's memory of a shared experience to match a friend's recollection.

**Duration:** The bigger the gap between an event and your memory of it, the greater the chance you will misremember it.

**Transferred Memories**: Transferring memories from one event to another.
    Example: Mistakenly remembering a friend at a party they didn't attend because they were at a similar party recently.

#### Other Cognitive Errors

**Projection**: Projecting our emotions and beliefs onto other people or the world.
    Example: Assuming others are angry when you're feeling irritable.

**Transference**: Transferring negative feelings towards a safer person or object.
    Example: Taking out frustration with a boss on a family member.

**Confirmation Bias:** We can notice and exaggerate evidence that confirms our beliefs and suspicions. This occurs when evidence seems to overwhelmingly support our view.

**Denial**: Ignoring or denying things we don't like about the world or ourselves, despite evidence.
    Example: Refusing to acknowledge a gambling problem despite financial difficulties.

**A Little Bit of Knowledge**: Just because you know a lot about one thing doesn't mean you are an expert in other things. It is good to know where your ignorance lies.

**False Consensus**: Thinking that many people agree with something when they don't.
    Example: Assuming most people share your political views because your close friends do.

**Naive Realism**: The belief that our sensory experience presents the world exactly as it is in reality.
    Example: Believing that the way we perceive colors is the only way they can be perceived, ignoring variations in color perception among individuals.

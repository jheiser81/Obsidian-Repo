## Comments

```
#prints the words "Hello World"
print('Hello World')
```
### Single-Line Comments
In python, comments are created by using the `#` symbol. Comments are used to explain the code and make it easier to understand. Comments are ignored by the python interpreter and are not executed. The # is used to create a single line comment.

```
#this is a comment
#this is also a comment
#single-line comments are good for brief notes
```
### Multi-Line Comments
 To create a multi-line comment, you can use triple quotes `'''` or `"""`. This is useful when you want to write a comment that spans multiple lines, such as a detailed explanation of a function or a block of code. Multi-line comments are also known as docstrings, which are used to document functions, classes, and modules in Python.

```
'''This is a multi-line comment. It can span multiple lines and is typically used to create docstrings, which are used to provide detailed explanations of functions, classes, and modules in Python.'''
```
### Print Command
In Python, the "print" command is used to output to the console or terminal. The print command can be used to display text, numbers, variables, and expressions. The syntax for the print command is as follows:

```
print('Hello World')
```

Note that in order to print text, which is known as a string, text must be enclosed in either single quotes ' ' or double quotes " ". Printing numbers or variables does not require quotes.

### Single-Line Comments
In python, comments are created by using the `#` symbol. Comments are used to explain the code and make it easier to understand. Comments are ignored by the python interpreter and are not executed. The # is used to create a single line comment.

`#this is a comment`
`#this is also a comment`
`#single-line comments are good for short comments`

 To create a multi-line comment, you can use triple quotes `'''` or `"""`. This is useful when you want to write a comment that spans multiple lines, such as a detailed explanation of a function or a block of code. Multi-line comments are also known as docstrings, which are used to document functions, classes, and modules in Python.

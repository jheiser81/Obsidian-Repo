## Comments
`#prints the words "Hello World"`
`print('Hello World')`

In python, comments are created by using the `#` symbol. Comments are used to explain the code and make it easier to understand. Comments are ignored by the python interpreter and are not executed. The # is used to create a single line comment.

`#this is a comment`
`#this is also a comment`
`#single-line comments cannot be split over multiple lines. If you try to do so, you will get a syntax error.`

 To create a multi-line comment, you can use triple quotes `'''` or `"""`. 
`'''This is a multi-line comment. This is a multi-line comment. This is a multi-line comment.'''`
